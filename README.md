TestFM
=========
Test suite for Foreman-Maintain(https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_maintain)

# Quickstart

The following is only a brief setup guide for TestFM.
The section on Running the Tests provides a more comprehensive guide to using
TestFM.

TestFM requires SSH access to the server system under test, and this SSH access
is implemented by pytest-ansible.

Get the source code and install dependencies:

$ git clone https://github.com/ntkathole/TestFM.git
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Thatâ€™s it! You can now go ahead and start testing The Foreman Maintain.
However, there are a few other things you need to do before continuing:

1. Make sure ssh-key is copied to the test system.

2. Make sure foreman maintain is installed on foreman/satellite server.

Running the Tests

Before running any tests, you must add foreman/satellite hostname to
TestFM/inventory file.

That done, you can run tests using pytest :

$ pytest --ansible-host-pattern foreman --ansible-user=root  --ansible-inventory TestFM/inventory
tests/

It is possible to run a specific subset of tests:

$ pytest --ansible-host-pattern foreman --ansible-user=root --ansible-inventory TestFM/inventory
tests/test_case.py
$ pytest --ansible-host-pattern foreman --ansible-user=root  --ansible-inventory TestFM/inventory
tests/test_case.py::test_case_name

TestFM is compatible with Python 2.7.
